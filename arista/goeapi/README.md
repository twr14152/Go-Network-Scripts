### GoEAPI
I found that the goeapi documentation was rather sparse. It was decent for show commands but configuration was lacking. After playing around with and looking at go packages documentation I got a feel for what it was capable of. I did sort out how to use it for configuration. I definately feel like this framework could use some attention. Doesn;t appear to be appear to be actively updated.

### GoEAPI
I found that the goeapi documentation was rather sparse. It was decent for show commands but configuration documentation was lacking. After playing around with it and looking at go.dev package documentation I got a feel for what it was capable of. I did sort out how to use it for configuration. I definately feel like this framework could use some attention. Doesn't appear to be actively updated.

I would say between pyeapi and goeapi I would probably stick with pyeapi. It is useable though.
